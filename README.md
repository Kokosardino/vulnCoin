#  vulnCoin

vulnCoin is a highly vulnerable blockchain server powered by the PoS protocol. The implementation provides tools to run the proof of stake consensus protocol, but it does not necessarily enforce them. Our goal was to make the server as simple as possible, while providing the tools to simulate a real PoS network run.

## 1. Accounts 

When the server is started, its address is generated from a received string. This address is further referred to as the `vulnCoin address` and is a 64 characters long hexadecimal string. The network does not use any kind of asymmetric cryptography, as we aimed to keep the server as simple as possible. In doing so, we have opened up the network of vulnCoin servers to a major attack vector - anyone can spend a transaction output held by another network participant. We overcome this problem by stating that in our simulations we expect all network nodes to act honestly, thus simulating that the network is protected against said problem.

## 2. Transactions

The server uses a simplified UTXO model, where newly created outputs do not reference previous inputs. They are, however, moved between the mempool, the stakepool and the pool of spendable outputs. For a transaction to become spendable, it must be embedded into a block. The transaction outputs have six properties, namely:
* Address
    * The address of the holder of the output.
* Amount
    * The amount of cryptocurrency held in the transaction (for simplicity purposes always set to $10$).
* Passed
    * Logs how many times the coin has been passed in the network, creating a notion of output chaining.
* Coinbase
    * A bool value indicating whether the transaction output was generated by a coinbase transaction.
* Timestamp
    * A timestamp indicating the time at which the transaction output was created.
* txid
    * The transaction ID is defined as $\text{sha256}(\text{address} || \text{amount} || \text{passed} || \text{coinbase} || \text{timestamp})$, where $||$ is a standard string concatenation operator.
    * Although many sources of entropy are used, in our PoCs (with only three servers!) we always sleep for one second after creating a transaction, to completely remove the threat of duplicate txids existing in the network.

## 3. Block
Blocks consist of three properties:
* prevBlockHash
  * The hash of a block is defined as $\text{sha256}(\text{prevBlockHash} || \text{transactionsHash})$, where $||$ is a standard string concatenation operator.
* transactionsHash
  * The transaction hash is defined as $\text{sha256}(\text{txid}_0 || \text{txid}_1 ||\dots||\text{txid}_n)$, where $||$ is a standard string concatenation operator and $\text{txid}_0, \text{txid}_1, \dots,\text{txid}_n \in \text{Transactions}$.
* Transactions
  *  A vector of txids of the transactions embedded into the block.

Legitimacy of the cryptographic link is ensured during the block creation process and we assume no node has an intent to break it. 
## 4. Consensus

The network does not enforce consensus, it cannot do so without employing more robust cryptographicall techniques. It does, however, equip the network participants with the tools for employing the consensus. These tools are used to enforce the consensus in the PoC scripts. The consensus above the network is defined as following process:

<img src="vulncoin_consensus_validation.png"> </img>

`t`
 * The `genesis` block is created automatically by the network.
 * The network users can stake for a chance to be selected as the creator of the block `#1`, but the stakePool has to be finalised before the time `t+1`.

 `t+1`
 * The stakepool for the `genesis` block and the `genesis` block are used as inputs for the pseudorandom function that selects the block creator from the stakepool `#1`.
 * The stakepool for the block `#2` is opened.

 `t+2`
 * The stakepool for the block `#1` and the block `#1` are used as inputs for the pseudorandom function that selects the block creator from the stakepool `#2`.
 * The stakepool for the block `#3` is opened.

 The whole process continues in the same fashion until the network is stopped.
 
 Let $H$ represent the `SHA256` hash of the last block in the blockchain, $\{a_1, a_2, \dots,a_n\} \in S$ a stakepool, where each vulnCoin address $a$ of a coin holder is represented as a hexadecimal string and $N$ the number of addresses in the current stakepool. Furthermore, please consider the function $\text{first32bits}()$ which returns the first 32 bits of a string. The pseudorandom selection function is implemented as:

 $$ \text{IndexOfValidator} \equiv (\text{first32bits}(H) + \text{first32bits}(a_1) + \dots + \text{first32bits}(a_n))\mod{N} $$

## 5. Coin age
Because we wanted to create a PoC of the coin age accumulation attack, we needed to implement an option for the coin age to be a factor in the consensus process. The whole concept is implemented with a flag passed during the start of a server. The implementation is very simplistic and ineffective, but it is enough for the purposes of the PoCs.
